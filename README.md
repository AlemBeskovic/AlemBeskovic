- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlemBeskovic
- I am interested in Computer Science and attend CCSU where I am pursuing my Bachelors in the Computer Science honors program.
- I am currently learning python and React and have a very good understanding of java, HTML, CSS, and springboot.
- Some projects that I have worked on include a tenant organizer for landlords that integrates chatgpt's API for a chatbox to quickly find information about different tenants and other data, a discord bot that helps students find iternships near them, and numerous school related projects.
- You can reach me on my student email at abeskovic@my.ccsu.edu or my personal email at Alembeskovic123@gmail.com.
